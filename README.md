molviewfmt
==========
The universal code formatter for the MolView project. This program automatically
formats all code in the underlying repositories to match the style conventions.
When possible, `molviewfmt` tries to follow a default convention such as the
standard conventions for Go and Dart. The specific style conventions that are
used by `molviewfmt` are described in the
[documentation](http://molviewfmt.readthedocs.org).
